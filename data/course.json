  "course_description": "Our goal is to help you develop a framework for understanding financial, managerial, and tax reports. The course goal is divided into five subordinate challenges that can help you organize the way you learn accounting:\n\n1.  The record keeping and reporting challenge\n2.  The computation challenge\n3.  The judgment challenge\n4.  The usage challenge\n5.  The search challenge\n\nThe course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events generating them. Restricted to first-year Sloan MBA students.\n\n##### Acknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgment is hereby given to Professor G. Peter Wilson for his authorship of the following content in this course:\n\n*   The Five Challenges (see Syllabus and Lecture 1)\n*   \"What Do Intel and Accountants Have in Common?\" (see Lecture 1)\n*   A Conceptual Framework for Financial Accounting (see Lecture 1)\n",
